This is a little sideproject of mine, basically a Next.js rewrite of [PetrolStationApp](https://github.com/hugohabicht01/PetrolStationApp).
I have never used React nor Next.js before and I'm currently just toying around with this, so expect some antipatterns...

*This only works inside Germany* due to the fact that the prices are fetched from https://creativecommons.tankerkoenig.de, which only has data from the MTK-S, a German federal agency
